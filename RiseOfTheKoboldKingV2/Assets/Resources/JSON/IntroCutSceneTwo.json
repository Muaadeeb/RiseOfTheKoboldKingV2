    "The kobold kingdoms have always been divided racially based upon the color of their scales. This formed the six tribes, the Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, White, and Black. For ages uncounted, the rule of six tribes fought tooth and claw for supremacy. The ruthless leaders of these tribes had an abundance of hate for all kind but their own.",
    "During this dark age no kobold was safe beyond the warmth of their hearth fire. Vendettas became commonplace and bounty hunters collected their fair due. Soon, the term ‘Blutgeldrachen’ symbolized the acceptance of going out and smiting a kobold with the intent of reward as small as a copper tool, or as big as a shadow magic crystal.",
    "However, one day, a few kobolds from each tribe spoke to the leader of their tribe and tried to organize a 7th tribe; The Free Tribe. Soon, many kobolds from each tribe were laying down their weapons, and trying to get more kobolds to join them. After a couple years, the first tribal leader decided to join the Free Tribe. The White Tribe had been the first to become peaceful. The other leaders realized that if they kept this war up, the entirety of their color would go extinct, like the Purple kobolds had so long ago. And so, every leader soon promised their partnership with the Free Tribe.",
    "Eventually  the mighty Kobold Kingdoms came into a state of unease(insert map) after the king was assassinated. By an unknown being. With the King that once kept peace lying dead, leaders tried to maintain order, but it didn’t last long. Shortly after the news of his death reached the public, riots broke out. Clans of Kobolds went town to town destroying everything and killing anyone who got in their way.” The guards put up their best effort, but couldn’t hold off for too long."
